// Pure Recursion Tips
// 1. For arrays, use methods like slice, the spread operator,
// and concat that make copies of arrays so you do not mutate them

// 2. Remember that strings are immutable so you will need to use methods
// like slice, substr, or substring to make copies of strings

// 3. To make copies of objects use Object.assign, or the spread operator
