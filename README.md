| Heaps          |                      |

## Algorithms
* Big O Notation
  * Time complexity
  * Space complexity
If not specified, talks about _auxiliary space complexity_ which doesn't consider the space taken by the input)

* Performance of JavaScript objects and arrays
 * Big O notation of object methods  
`Object.keys` - O(N)  
`Object.values` - O(N)  
`Object.entries` - O(N)  
`hasOwnProperty` - O(1)  
 * Big O notation of object operations   
_insertion_ - O(1)  
_removal_ - O(1)  
_updating_ - O(1)  
_access_ - O(1)  
_searching_ - O(N) for liner searching  
 * Big O notation of array operations  
_insertion_ - depends on where to insert (beginning, middle, end, etc.)  
_removal_ - depends on the position of elements to be removed (beginning, middle, end, etc.)  
_access_ - O(1)  
_searching_ - O(N) for liner searching  

* Problem Solving Patterns
  * Frequency Counters
  * Multiple Pointers
For instance, *two pointer techniques* will be illustrated in some code examples. 
  * Sliding Windows

* Recursion (An important programming method)

* Searching Algorithms

* Sorting Algorithms (basic and intermediate algorithms)
-----------------
## Data Structures
What is data structure?  
They are collections of values, relationship among them, and operations that can applied to them. Typical data structures in JavaScript: *Array*, *Object*,*Graph*, *Trees* etc.
