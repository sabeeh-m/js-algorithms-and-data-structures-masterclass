// UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
